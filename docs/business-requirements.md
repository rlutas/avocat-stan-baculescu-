### 8.4 Key Architectural Decisions

#### 8.4.1 Next.js App Router vs Pages Router

**Recommendation:** Next.js 14+ App Router

**Rationale:**
- Server Components for improved performance
- Streaming and Suspense for better UX
- Nested layouts reduce code duplication
- Better SEO with metadata API
- Future-proof (Pages Router in maintenance mode)
- Improved data fetching patterns

#### 8.4.2 Authentication Strategy

**Recommendation:** Supabase Auth

**Rationale:**
- Built-in user management
- Email verification included
- Social login support
- Row-level security in PostgreSQL
- Session management
- Cost-effective
- Easy integration with Supabase database

**Alternative:** NextAuth.js (if more customization needed)

#### 8.4.3 State Management

**Recommendation:** Layered approach

1. **Server State:** TanStack Query (React Query)
2. **Form State:** React Hook Form
3. **Global Client State:** React Context (minimal) or Zustand
4. **URL State:** Next.js router (searchParams)

**Rationale:** Use the right tool for each type of state, avoid over-engineering

#### 8.4.4 Payment Gateway

**Recommendation:** Stripe

**Rationale:**
- Industry-standard security (PCI DSS Level 1)
- Excellent documentation and developer experience
- Supports Romanian market
- Webhook system for reliable payment tracking
- Built-in invoice generation
- Refund management
- Future scalability (subscriptions, multi-currency)

**Alternative:** PayU (if local preference)

#### 8.4.5 AI Provider

**Recommendation:** OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo

**Rationale:**
- Best-in-class document understanding
- Multilingual support (Romanian)
- Structured output capabilities
- Reasonable pricing for expected volume
- Extensive legal knowledge in training data
- Active development and improvements

**Considerations:**
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Monitor costs (implement token limits)
- Cache results where possible
- Consider local AI alternatives for future (cost optimization)

#### 8.4.6 File Storage

**Recommendation:** Supabase Storage

**Rationale:**
- Integrated with Supabase Auth (RLS policies)
- CDN included
- Reasonable pricing
- Simple API
- Automatic image optimization

**Alternative:** AWS S3 (if scale requires it in future)

#### 8.4.7 Email Service

**Recommendation:** Resend

**Rationale:**
- Modern API
- Excellent deliverability
- Transaction email focus
- React Email integration (beautiful templates)
- Reasonable pricing

**Alternative:** SendGrid (more established, higher volume)

#### 8.4.8 Calendar Integration Approach

**Recommendation:** Direct Google Calendar API integration

**Implementation:**
1. OAuth 2.0 for lawyer Google account access
2. Two-way sync via webhooks
3. Store Google Calendar event IDs in database
4. Conflict detection before booking
5. Automatic Google Meet link generation

**Alternative Considered:** In-app calendar only
- Rejected because lawyers need calendar in their existing workflows
- Google Calendar is industry standard for professionals

---

### 8.5 Scalability Strategy

#### Phase 1: Initial Launch (Variant 1 or 2)
- Single region deployment (EU for GDPR compliance)
- Vercel/Netlify serverless architecture
- Supabase managed database (sufficient for < 10,000 users)
- Client-side caching (React Query)
- CDN for static assets

#### Phase 2: Growth (500+ consultations/month)
- Database connection pooling (Supabase Pooler)
- Implement Redis caching layer for frequent queries
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and dynamic imports
- Upgrade to Supabase Pro plan

#### Phase 3: Scale (1,000+ consultations/month)
- Consider dedicated database instance
- Implement background job processing (for AI analysis)
- Multi-region CDN optimization
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database read replicas if needed
- Monitoring and performance budgets

---

### 8.6 Development Environment

**Recommended Setup:**
```bash
# Package Manager
pnpm (faster, more efficient than npm/yarn)

# Node Version
Node.js 20.x LTS

# Development Tools
- VS Code with recommended extensions
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
  - Prisma
  - GitLens

# Environment Variables (.env.local)
- Database connection strings
- API keys (OpenAI, Stripe, Google, etc.)

   - Add client as guest
   - Generate Google Meet link
   - Store event ID in database
4. Webhook notifications:
   - Listen for external calendar changes
   - Sync to app database
   - Prevent double-booking
```

**Error Handling:**
- Retry logic for failed sync
- Fallback to manual calendar if sync fails
- Alert lawyer to conflicts

---

**Google Meet API**

**Purpose:** Auto-generate video consultation links

**Requirements:**
- Automatic meeting link creation when consultation booked

4. Sends to OpenAI with structured prompt
5. Receives analysis: summary, key points, parties, dates, issues
6. Stores analysis in database
7. Notifies lawyer that brief is ready
```

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are a legal assistant analyzing consultation materials.

Client Description:
{client_description}

Uploaded Documents:
{extracted_text}

Please provide a structured analysis:
1. Summary (max 200 words)
